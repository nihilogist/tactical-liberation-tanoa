# Tactical Distractions presents KP Liberation

This mission is a fork of the magnificent *Liberation* mission from Greuh and KillahPotatoes. It has been customized and reconfigured by Tactical Distractions.

## Overview

The island of Tanoa holds the capital of the Horizons Island Federation, an autocratic military-backed government. Supported by the United States for many years, they have imported large amounts of military hardware, and many former soldiers in the USMC have found lucrative opportunities in the island's military as advisors over the years.

Recent geopolitical upheavals have changed the Federation's alignment away from the West, and now NATO forces cannot permit this island to function as an independent and aggressive foreign policy actor in the Southern Pacific.

A military intervention from the British Armed Forces with US air support has been launched, tasked with removing the military regime from power and starting the population on a road back to self-governance.

# Tactical Distractions presents KP Liberation

This mission is a fork of the magnificent *Liberation* mission from Greuh and KillahPotatoes. It has been customized and reconfigured by Tactical Distractions.

## Overview

The island of Tanoa is run by the Western Administration Movement, a militarily-backed government. Supported by the United States for many years, they have imported large amounts of military hardware, and many former soldiers in the USMC have found lucrative opportunities in the island's army and police forces. 

Recent geopolitical upheavals have changed the balance of power, and now NATO forces cannot permit this island to function as a conveniently-deniable arm of American foreign policy in the Pacific arena.

A task force from the British Armed Forces has been tasked with removing the military regime from power and starting the population on a road back to self-governance.
